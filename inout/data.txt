Respected Sir/Madam,

I, [Your Full Name], a resident of [Your Complete Address], had filed an RTI application dated [Date of RTI submission] to the Public Information Officer (PIO), Tahsildar Office, Srinivaspur Taluk, Kolar District, seeking certified records related to:

Survey No. 19

Jangamashettihalli Village

Ronur Hobli, Srinivaspur Taluk, Kolar District

For the year 1981–82, specifically mentioning the LRM (Land Reforms / Tenancy) records.

Unfortunately, no response was received from the PIO within the 30-day period as mandated by the RTI Act. 

This delay has caused undue hardship in tracing historical tenancy rights and land records related to my family's ancestral land. I now humbly request the Karnataka State Information Commission to:

Take cognizance of the inaction by  PIO 

Direct the concerned authorities to immediately provide the requested information.

Initiate appropriate action under Section 20 of the RTI Act for non-compliance.

Details for Reference:

RTI Application Date: [dd-mm-yyyy]

PIO Office: Tahsildar, Srinivaspur Taluk

RTI Mode: [In person]

Description: Request for tenancy/LRM record of Survey No. 19, Jangamashettihalli, 1981–82

I hereby declare that this appeal is being filed under Section 19(3) of the RTI Act, 2005, and all statements made herein are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Yours sincerely,
[TEJAS KUMAR KN]
